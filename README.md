# Science Museum

![image](/images/read-me-img-exploratorium.png)

The purpose of this project is to put into practice and showcase the skills learned over my first semester of Front-end Development studies.

## Description

An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.

For this project various aspects of front-end development were required, including:

- The site must have a design that appeals to the target audience.
- The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
- Compositional principles, typography, and colour schemes must be considered.
- Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
- The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
- The site should download quickly and not be overly “heavy”. Images should be at most 200kb.
- The site should consider WCAG principles, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation, and colour usage.
- The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on various devices.
- The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of meta tags and alt text).
